# Brain Tumor Prediction App

This Flask web application allows users to upload brain MRI images and predict whether a brain tumor is present, as well as identify the potential class of the tumor.  
The backend model is trained on medical imaging datasets obtained from Kaggle and leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify brain tumors.

## Project Background

This project is an improved version of the original group project, "Project 4: Brain Tumor Classification and Detection Using Deep-Learning Models."

## Improvements Made

After completing the initial group project, I made several enhancements to improve functionality, usability, and organization:  

1. **Project Restructuring**:  
   - The entire Flask application has been reorganized into a structured directory layout, making it more maintainable and easier to navigate.  
2. **Enhanced Aesthetics**:  
   - Polished HTML/CSS styling has been applied to improve the application's visual appeal and provide a better user experience.  
3. **User Authentication**:  
   - Added user registration, login, and logout functionality to enhance interactivity and introduce a layer of security for user data.

## User Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository:  

```
git clone https://github.com/Oatsinthepine/flask_project_restructure.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:  

```
cd flask_project_restructure
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 3: Create `config.py`

Create a file named `config.py` in the root directory of the project. Use the following template to configure the application:  

```python
import os

class Configuration:
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-custom-secret-key'  # Replace with your own secret key
    BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = f"sqlite:///{os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'instance', 'user.db')}"
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'model_checkpoint_epoch_177.h5')
```

Ensure you replace `'your-custom-secret-key'` with a secure key of your choice.

---

### Step 4: Initialize the Database

Run the `init_db.py` script to initialize the database:

```
python init_db.py
```

Upon success, a new SQLite database file (`instance/user.db`) will be created.

---

### Step 5: Start the Application

Run the Flask app locally using:

```
python run.py
```

The app will be accessible at:  
**http://localhost:{port}**

Replace `{port}` with the port number displayed in the console (default is usually `5000`).
