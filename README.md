# Brain Tumor Prediction App

This Flask web application allows users to upload brain MRI images and predict whether a brain tumor is present, as well as identify the potential class of the tumor.  
The backend model is trained on medical imaging datasets obtained from Kaggle and leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify brain tumors.

## Project Background

This project is an improved version of the original group project **"Project 4: Brain Tumor Classification and Detection Using Deep-Learning Models."**

## Improvements Made

After completing the initial group project, I made several enhancements to improve functionality, usability, and organization:  

1. **Project Restructuring**:  
   - The entire Flask application has been reorganized into a structured directory layout, making it more maintainable and easier to navigate.  
2. **Enhanced Aesthetics**:  
   - Polished HTML/CSS styling applied to improve the application's view and provide a better user experience.  
3. **User Authentication**:  
   - Added user registration, login, and logout functionality to enhance interactivity.

## **User Guide**

### Step 0: Please ensure you have set up an dedicated directory, and activate your virtual environment. 

**As to run the project locally you need to pip install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` file.**

if you are not familiar with how to set up a virtual environment, please refer to the following guide:
- [Python Virtual Environment Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- [How to create virtual environment using Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments/)

**And ensure you have `python-3.10.13` installed when you creating the virtual environment.**

---

### Step 0.5: For local running flask app, please ensure you has installed SQLite3 on your machine. This project uses SQLite as the database, you need to have SQLite installed.
- [link to SQLite installation guide](https://sqlite.org/)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository:  

```
git clone https://github.com/Oatsinthepine/flask_project_restructure.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:  

```
cd flask_project_restructure
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 3: Create `config.py` file

Create a file named `config.py` in the root directory of the project. This file should be in the same directory as `run.py`.
Use the following template to configure the application:  

```python
import os

class Configuration:
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-custom-secret-key'  # Replace this with your own secret key in string format
    BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = f"sqlite:///{os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'instance', 'user.db')}"
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'model_checkpoint_epoch_177.h5')
```

**_Ensure you replace `'your-custom-secret-key'` with a secure key of your choice to run the program._**

---

### Step 4: Initialise the Database

To set up the local db instance and connect it to the SQLite, please run the following command in sequence:

first enter your IDE's terminal, and navigate to the project folder, then run:

``` bash
flask --app flask_app shell
from flask_app import create_app, db
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

Upon execution, if success, a new SQLite database file (`instance/user.db`) will be created.

---

### Step 5: Start the Application

Run the Flask app locally using:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will be accessible at:  
**http://localhost:{port}**

Replace `{port}` with the port number displayed in the console (default is usually `5000`).

---

### Then you can access the app in your web browser and start using it üéâ!
